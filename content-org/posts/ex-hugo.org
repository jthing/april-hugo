* Write entries in org mode with ox-hugo

I updated my Emacs config to accept ox-hugo. This is a Org sub-mode that allows org
documents to be exported as markup for hugo.  A new sub-directory contents-org was also
added to hold the org versions of the files. It is set up so that the files are
automatically converted to markup when saved.

# Local Variables:
# eval: (set-fill-column 90)
# eval: (auto-fill-mode t)
# eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode t)
# End:

#  LocalWords:  config hugo

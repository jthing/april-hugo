* APL neural net tutorial

The “Learn APL with Neural Networks” YouTube series aims at teaching you APL while
building a basic machine learning framework from the ground up.

By the time you are done, you will have created a machine learning framework and used it
to train a neural network that recognises handwritten digits.  You will also be able to
tackle other problems you pick because of the flexibility of what you created!

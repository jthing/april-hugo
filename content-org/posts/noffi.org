Nocturnal FFI is a novel kind of FFI for Common Lisp. The basic idea is that it should not require any more effort to use some C library from Lisp than it is from C. A mere

#include <foo.h>
should suffice to begin using the foo library.

However, at the moment this is still work in progress. It's not as fast and slim as it could be and the API is likely to change.

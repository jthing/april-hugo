I'm getting to understand some more about the SPIR-V format. This guide
(https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Guide) has been helpful. I can
tell now that 3b-spirv often abstracts the result locations instead of
making them explicit. More updates to come. Have you been able to
execute a sample SPIR-V kernel yet? Talk soon,

Andrew
